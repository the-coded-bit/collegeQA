College QA is Question and Answer platform.   
It's a platform where Students, Professors, other staff come together,  
discuss the related topics, address the issues face by the students.  


**The thought might be aroused, why not `Quora`?**  
- `Quora` is public forum, where discussing the issues regarding the one community `beats the purpose of public QA forum`


- coming up with separate plafrom ensures the `Integrity` of institute..

- another use case is: students, Professors having the institute generated email and password, can only login, in the platform, which ensures the information leaks must be less.  
    `though institute issued email and password authentication will be added soon...ðŸ˜€`  


## Features

- Only Institute registered Login/Signup emails.
- Question Section, to ask various questions
- Answers Section, where one can share/read the Answers
- Anonymous feedback section, where one can put his/her reviews about something without revealing their identity..
- Profile section to view one's own Profile, how many questions asked, how many were answered etc..
